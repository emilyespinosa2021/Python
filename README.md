🐍 Python Coursework Repository 🐍

Hello! This repository showcases my experience with Python programming. Topics include working with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib for data manipulation, numerical operations, and visualization. You'll find scripts demonstrating how to clean, transform, and analyze datasets and generate insightful plots and summaries. The work also includes practical examples of loading data from CSV files, handling missing values, filtering and grouping data, and applying basic statistical methods.
